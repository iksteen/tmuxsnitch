//! Diff-once, broadcast-to-all live streaming.
//!
//! A publisher feeds successive states into a [`Live`] — the standalone server
//! publishes [`Frame`]s (deltas are computed here, once), the hub publishes the
//! client's already-encoded wire messages (applied to the stored frame, forwarded
//! **verbatim** — no recomputation). Every subscribed viewer gets the same
//! pre-encoded message. The wire messages are compact JSON the browser renderer
//! (`viewer.ts`) applies; the push client emits the identical format, so one
//! encoder/decoder pair covers both hops.
//!
//! There is **no `"t"` tag**: every message type owns one payload key, and the
//! decoder dispatches on which is present. `c` must be tested FIRST — the
//! single-cell form flattens its style letters (`f,g,b,d,i,u,n,w`) into the
//! envelope, so `b`/`d`/`w` there must not be read as banner/full/width.
//!
//! - `{"d":[block,…], w, h, p?}` — a full snapshot (sent to each viewer on
//!   connect, and whenever the screen size changes). `p` = cursor; absent = hidden.
//! - `{"r":[[row, left, text, style?],…], p?}` — changed lines: row index, the
//!   cell index the span starts at, then the block. On diff-family messages `p`
//!   is TRI-STATE (absent = unchanged, null = hidden, [row, col] = moved); a
//!   cursor-only move drops `r` entirely, leaving just `{"p":[row, col]}`.
//! - `{"c":[row, left, "…"], p?, …style}` — a uniform span: one cell per
//!   codepoint, the flattened style applying to every cell. The hottest diffs
//!   (spinner ticks, typing echo, appended log lines) take this form.
//! - `{"l":[row, left, text, style?], p?}` — a single changed line that isn't
//!   uniform (mixed styles, blanks-as-0, or cluster cells).
//! - `{"b": html}` — an error banner.
//! - `{"v": proto, js}` — version hello, first event of every SSE stream: the
//!   wire proto and the baked viewer.js content tag. A page that mismatches on
//!   either reloads itself (see [`PROTO`]).
//!
//! A block (see [`CellBlock`]) is positional `[text]` / `[text, style]`: `text` is
//! one cell per codepoint in merged strings (`["…"]` = one multi-codepoint-grapheme
//! cell; `0` = an empty-text cell, vestigial now that blanks are canonicalized to
//! spaces at the parse boundary, but still decoded), `style` is
//! `[start, len, {attrs}]` runs with `1`-flags. Diffs are per-line minimal spans — measured (see
//! `zz_measure_wire_cost` history), merging lines into rectangles never paid.
//!
//! Connecting is **lock-free** (`/s/<id>/events` is public — the id is the read
//! capability — so a connect flood must not be able to stall the publisher): deltas
//! are broadcast tagged with a monotonic sequence number, the current state lives in
//! an [`ArcSwap`] snapshot stamped with the seq it reflects, and a viewer subscribes,
//! loads the snapshot, and skips any delta the snapshot already covers. Each SSE
//! event carries its seq as the `id:` line (`e.lastEventId` in the browser — the
//! native hook for a future `Last-Event-ID` resume).
