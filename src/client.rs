//! Push client: run the live PTY pipeline locally, but stream its frames to a
//! remote hub over one WebSocket instead of serving them.
//!
//! It opens a single `/push` WebSocket and runs a register-then-stream state
//! machine over it: the first message is a [`RegisterBody`] (page CSS + render
//! config + fonts), then a full picture, then only the deltas against what it
//! already sent — the exact wire messages the hub forwards to its viewers verbatim.
//! The WebSocket is authorized once at the upgrade (a bad key → 403, fatal), so the
//! upgrade succeeding is what gates taking over the terminal: a down or rejecting
//! hub is reported and retried *before* the command runs.
//!
//! Liveness: the client pings every [`PING_INTERVAL`] and treats a run of
//! unanswered pongs — or any send that stalls past [`SEND_TIMEOUT`] — as a dead
//! connection, so a black-holed hub (a `docker kill`/crash that never sends a FIN)
//! is detected in seconds instead of the kernel's ~15-minute retransmission timeout.
//! A clean shutdown (the hub's SIGTERM Close, or a network FIN) is detected at once.
//! On any drop it reconnects with a fresh register + full.
