//! Inline-image interceptor: pull iTerm2 (OSC 1337) and kitty (APC `_G`) image
//! sequences out of the raw PTY byte stream so they can be forwarded to the browser
//! as `<img>` overlays. vt100 drops these sequences entirely (it implements no
//! DCS/APC/OSC-1337 handler), so the images would otherwise be lost.
//!
//! We only *extract* image sequences; every other byte passes straight through as
//! a [`Step::Passthrough`] to vt100, which is a streaming parser and
//! reassembles partial escape sequences across calls on its own. So the only thing this scanner has to
//! reassemble across PTY read boundaries is an image sequence itself. Like vte and
//! real terminals, an in-flight sequence is *cancelled* by CAN/SUB or an ESC that
//! doesn't form ST (a Ctrl-C'd transfer recovers at the next prompt repaint rather
//! than swallowing the session), and one that outgrows [`MAX_SEQ_BYTES`] is
//! discarded as it streams so it can't grow memory unboundedly.
//!
//! Handled: iTerm2 OSC 1337 `File` — single-shot or multipart
//! (`MultipartFile`/`FilePart`/`FileEnd`); kitty `_G` in
//! PNG (`f=100`) or raw RGB/RGBA (`f=24`/`f=32`, re-encoded to PNG) over the
//! DIRECT (`t=d`) transmission medium only; and sixel DCS (`ESC P … q … ST`,
//! decoded to RGBA and re-encoded to PNG).
//!
//! The kitty file (`t=f`/`t=t`) and shared-memory (`t=s`) mediums carry a
//! filesystem path / shm name in the payload — and this stream is UNTRUSTED. We
//! deliberately DO NOT read them: an injected control sequence (a hostile MOTD,
//! tainted tarball, booby-trapped README) would otherwise exfiltrate any file the
//! broadcaster can read to every viewer. The local terminal still renders those
//! natively; the mirror recovers them because detect-mode clients fall back to
//! direct transmission when we decline the medium (see the tee in `pty.rs`).
