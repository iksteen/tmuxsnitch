# Enhancement roadmap

Ordered plan for the work unlocked by vendoring `crates/vt100` (see the provenance
header in its `Cargo.toml`), plus the cross-layer features that build on it. Every
claim below was verified against the vendored 0.16.2 source at writing time
(2026-07). Work top to bottom within a phase; phases are priority tiers, not
strict dependencies — the only hard edge is called out on the items themselves.

Ground rules that apply throughout:

- **Mirror fidelity is the bar**: render in the browser exactly what the local
  terminal shows — never more, never less. A feature the local terminal doesn't
  render (e.g. OSC 8 on a dumb terminal) must not appear in the mirror.
- **Vendored-crate patches** land as separate commits and are listed in
  `crates/vt100/Cargo.toml`'s provenance header (keep it current).
- **Wire changes**: purely additive optional keys need no salt bump; anything an
  old decoder would *misread* does (see the `SALT` comment in `proto.rs`).

## Phase 1 — quick wins

Small, self-contained, each in the established SCOSC/SCORC pattern
(`screen.rs`/`perform.rs` + tests in the vendored suite + a consumer-side pin
where it matters).

1. **Unhandled-sequence telemetry.** The parser is constructed with default
   callbacks, so unhandled CSI/escape/OSC vanish silently — which is exactly why
   the SCOSC gap shipped unnoticed. Implement `vt100::Callbacks` in `pty.rs`
   with `unhandled_csi`/`unhandled_escape`/`unhandled_osc`/`unhandled_char`
   logging once per distinct sequence kind (debug level; never per-occurrence —
   a busy TUI can emit thousands per second). Do this FIRST: it converts every
   remaining gap on this page — and future ones — from a user bug report into a
   log line.

2. **REP (`CSI b`, repeat preceding graphic character).** Missing from the CSI
   dispatch, and both `xterm-256color` and `xterm-kitty` terminfo advertise
   `rep`, so ncurses ≥ 6 apps (vim, htop, tmux redraws) compress character runs
   into REP today — the mirror silently loses them. Requires remembering the
   last printed char on the screen (cleared on cursor movement/control, per
   xterm). Highest-value single fix: live content loss, a few lines.

3. **Cursor-movement batch.** One-liners each, missing from dispatch: `CSI f`
   (HVP, the CUP alias), `CSI Z` (CBT), `CSI I` (CHT), ``CSI ` `` (HPA),
   `CSI a` (HPR), `CSI e` (VPR). Plus real tab stops: `ESC H` (HTS) and
   `CSI g` (TBC) with a tab-stop table in `grid.rs` — `tab()` currently assumes
   fixed 8-column stops, and CBT/CHT need the table anyway. Wrong cursor
   position is the bug class of the powerline incident; this batch is cheap
   insurance against the rest of the family. One commit.

## Phase 2 — good to have

4. **First-class image placements in the grid** *(the reason the crate was
   vendored — replaces the corner-sentinel machinery)*. Today `pty.rs` tracks a
   placed image by writing four Plane-16 PUA sentinel glyphs into the vt100 grid
   at the image's corners and reconstructing the top-left each frame
   (`resolve_images`). It works, but it is an approximation with documented
   ponytails: interior overwrites can't punch holes in the overlay, kitty
   `a=p`/`a=d` are unimplementable, and the sentinel scan is a per-frame cost.
   Plan:
   - `crates/vt100`: give cells an optional image id (`Cell` grows a
     `Option<ImageId>`-shaped field; keep it `Copy`-friendly — an id, not the
     payload) and the `Grid` an id→placement table (top-left, cell extent).
     Placement stamps the id into the covered cells; vt100's own
     scroll/reflow/erase then manage lifetime *per cell*, exactly mirroring a
     cell-based sixel terminal's erase semantics — corner sampling becomes
     exact-region tracking for free.
   - `parse.rs`/`pty.rs`: on snapshot, derive each image's surviving cell
     region from the stamped cells (bounding box + which cells are gone);
     delete the sentinel/`drop_mark`/`resolve_images` machinery.
   - Wire: unchanged at first (`i` list on full frames, same placements —
     derivation changes, encoding doesn't). Per-cell erase (holes) needs a
     viewer clip mechanism later — ship region tracking first, holes as a
     follow-up (`ImagePlacement` gains an optional erased-cells key: additive,
     no salt bump).
   - Unlocked follow-ups (each small once ids exist): kitty `a=p` (id store —
     the `t`-then-`p` emitters that currently show nothing), `a=d` deletes,
     z-ordering.
   - Test strategy: port the existing sentinel tests (scroll/clip/evict,
     prompt-overwrite survival, wide-glyph columns) to the new mechanism before
     deleting the old one; they encode the erase-semantics contract.

5. **Modern SGR: undercurl, strikethrough, double underline, underline color.**
   The `sgr` match handles underline as exact `[4]`, so `4:3` (undercurl —
   helix and neovim diagnostics emit it) falls through and the underline is
   lost entirely; strikethrough (9/29), double underline (21), and underline
   color (58/59) are absent. Cross-layer: vendored `attrs.rs` storage → wire
   style-run flags (additive keys — old viewers ignore, no salt bump) →
   `viewer.ts` rendering (CSS `text-decoration-style: wavy` etc.). Kitty
   renders all of these locally, so the mirror is visibly wrong in editors
   daily. Gate: only emit wire flags the viewer renders.

6. **DECSCUSR (`CSI Sp q`) cursor shape.** Not tracked; vim's insert-mode beam
   renders as a block in the mirror. Track shape+blink in `Screen`, ship as a
   NEW optional wire key (do not change the existing `p` tri-state — old
   decoders must keep working; additive key, no salt bump), render
   block/beam/underline in the viewer.

## Phase 3 — nice to have

7. **OSC 8 hyperlinks.** Dropped today (no `[b"8", …]` arm). The viewer is a
   browser — real `<a>` links are the most natural rendering this project could
   offer, and kitty supports OSC 8 locally so fidelity permits it. Needs a
   per-cell link id in the vendored crate (pairs naturally with the image-id
   cell field from item 4), a link table on the wire (additive), and anchor
   rendering + `rel="noreferrer"` hygiene in the viewer. Decide explicitly how
   storm mode (canvas) degrades — likely links only in DOM mode.

8. **Damage tracking.** No dirty/damage state exists in the crate; every dirty
   frame does a full-screen `grid_from_screen` scan+alloc and `encode_delta`
   re-compares every row. A dirty-rows bitset maintained by `grid.rs`'s own
   write paths lets both skip clean rows. Perf only — the pipeline holds 30fps
   today (see `zz_measure_wire_cost`), so this earns its keep on large screens
   and single-cell updates (typing). Measure before/after; don't complicate the
   publish path for a win the numbers don't show.

9. **Scrollback.** The README's "not yet" item; not a fight — the vendored
   crate already has a scrollback buffer (`Parser::new`'s third arg, currently
   0) with `set_scrollback` for viewport positioning. The real work is product
   design: wire semantics for history (the diff protocol is screen-shaped),
   viewer UX (scroll = viewport offset messages?), and memory bounds per
   session on the hub. Write a design note before code; this one can balloon.

## Phase 4 — maybe one day

10. **Sixel interception via vte's DCS hooks.** vte routes DCS byte-by-byte
    through `hook`/`put`/`unhook` (vt100 implements none) — streaming, no size
    cap, string-cancellation semantics for free. But kitty APC isn't exposed by
    vte at all, and OSC payloads sit in a fixed 1024-byte buffer, so the
    interceptor must stay for kitty + iTerm2 regardless. Moving only sixel
    would mean two mechanisms where today there is one — do this only if vte
    itself is ever swapped/patched (vte is actively maintained; the vendor
    argument does not apply to it).

11. **Resize reflow.** `set_size` truncates/pads rows and clears wrap flags on
    width change; kitty reflows wrapped lines. The mirror diverges from the
    local screen after SIGWINCH until the next repaint — which fullscreen apps
    do immediately, so it self-heals in practice. Real reflow is the hardest
    item on this page for the smallest visible payoff. Documented divergence;
    revisit only if users actually hit it.

12. **Window title in the viewer.** vt100 already tracks OSC 0/2 titles; the
    viewer page title could follow the session's. Trivial-ish (additive wire
    key), just never important. Bundle it with whichever phase-2/3 item next
    touches the wire.

## Sequencing note

Items 4 and 7 both add a per-cell id side-table to the vendored grid — whoever
lands first should shape the mechanism generically (a small per-cell tag
namespace, ids resolved through a grid-owned table) so the second is a client,
not a second implementation.
