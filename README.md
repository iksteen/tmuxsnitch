# shellglass

A live glass over your shell: mirror a terminal session as live **HTML** in your browser.
You run an interactive command in a pseudo-terminal (the `script(1)` model) — it runs in
your terminal, the browser watches. Rendering is always **live** — terminal state is kept
in a long-lived vt100 parser and pushed to the browser over SSE, with no polling and no
per-tick subprocess — and carries Kitty-style `symbol_map` font overrides (map Unicode
codepoint ranges to specific fonts, e.g. Nerd Font glyph ranges) and **inline images**
(kitty graphics, iTerm2, sixel — mirrored when your terminal renders them).

Two ways to serve it:

- **Standalone** — mirror to a local browser (one process).
- **Hub + client** — a client streams its rendered frames to a remote **hub** that hosts
  the session at a URL. Good for sharing off-box.

```sh
shellglass serve                                  # mirror your $SHELL, watch at :8080
shellglass serve -- bash -l                        # or a specific command
shellglass push https://hub --key … -- bash        # or stream it to a hub
```

Each mode is a subcommand: `serve` (self-contained local viewer), `push` (stream to a
hub), `hub` (run a hub), plus `gen-key` / `print-id` helpers. Run `shellglass <cmd>
--help` for a command's flags. The command to mirror goes **last**, after any flags (use
`--` to separate it); omit it to mirror your `$SHELL`. The terminal is switched to raw
mode for the session and restored when the command exits (which also quits shellglass).
Unix only.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release
# binary at ./target/release/shellglass  (examples below use it)
```

## Quickstart: standalone (one shell)

```sh
./target/release/shellglass serve --bind 127.0.0.1:8080     # mirror your $SHELL
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ — the browser mirrors this terminal live
```

## Quickstart: hub + client (two shells)

The **secret** is the write capability; its hash — `hex(argon2id(secret))`, a
one-way, memory-hard derivation — is the **session id**, a read capability that
goes in the view URL. The hub only accepts pushes for session ids you pre-register
with `--allow`.

### Shell A — the hub

```sh
# 1. mint a secret and its session id (the id is needed for the hub's --allow)
./target/release/shellglass gen-key
#   key: <secret>   -> keep private; the client pushes with it
#   id:  <id>       -> public; add to the hub's --allow
SECRET='<the printed key>'
ID='<the printed id>'

# 2. run the hub, allowing that id (repeat --allow per client)
./target/release/shellglass hub --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --allow "$ID"
```

The hub needs no config — it just relays what clients push.
For access from other machines, bind `0.0.0.0:8080` and use the host's address.

### Shell B — the client

```sh
# same secret as the hub was configured for
export SHELLGLASS_KEY='change-me-to-a-long-random-secret'
./target/release/shellglass push http://127.0.0.1:8080 -- bash -l
```

The client prints its view URL on startup:

```
shellglass: pushing live to http://127.0.0.1:8080; view at http://127.0.0.1:8080/s/<id>
```

Open that `/s/<id>` URL in a browser. Viewing needs only the id (in the URL); pushing
needs the secret. A client whose key isn't on the hub's `--allow` list is rejected with
`403` at startup.

**Friendlier view URLs.** Alias a session id to a slug with `--allow <id>:<slug>` (e.g.
`--allow "$ID:demo"`) and the session is viewed at `/s/demo` instead of `/s/<64-hex-id>`.
The slug becomes the *only* view route — `/s/<id>` no longer resolves for an aliased
session — so share the slug URL with viewers. Pushing is unchanged (it still uses the
key, which hashes to the id). Every id and every slug must be unique across `--allow`;
a collision or a non-URL-safe slug is a startup error. With no `:slug`, the slug defaults
to the id, so `/s/<id>` keeps working as above.

> `gen-key` mints a secure 256-bit secret and prints its session id in one step;
> use the printed key as `SHELLGLASS_KEY` on the client and the printed id in the
> hub's `--allow`.

## Commands

`shellglass <command>` — run `shellglass <command> --help` for its full flags.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `serve` | self-contained: render locally and serve the viewer over HTTP |
| `push <url>` | client: render locally, stream frames to the hub at `<url>` |
| `hub` | run as a hub: relay clients' pushes (no config needed) |
| `sessions` | manage a hub's sessions over its management API: list, add, remove |
| `gen-key` | generate a random secret key, print it with its session id, and exit (`--api` for an API credential) |
| `print-id` | print the session id for `--key` and exit (`--api` for its API id) |

Flags by command:

| Flag | Commands | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| `[CMD]…` (positional) | serve, push | interactive command to mirror in a PTY; put it last (after `--`). Omit for your `$SHELL` |
| `--config <path>` | serve, push | TOML config (fonts, `symbol_map`, `template`); omit for defaults |
| `--bind <addr>` | serve, hub | HTTP listen address (default `127.0.0.1:8080`) |
| `--ssh-bind <addr>` | serve, hub | also serve a read-only ANSI view over SSH here; connect with `ssh -p <port> …` |
| `--ssh-host-key <path>` | serve, hub | OpenSSH host key for the SSH view (generated + persisted 0600 if absent) |
| `--key <secret>` | push, print-id | secret key (or `SHELLGLASS_KEY` env var) |
| `<url>` (positional) / `--key <api-key>` | sessions | hub base URL (like `push`'s) + management-API key (or `SHELLGLASS_API_KEY`) |
| `--allow <id>[:<slug>]` | hub | a session id permitted to push, optionally aliased to a view-URL slug; repeat per client. Others get `403` |
| `--api-allow <api-id>` | hub | an API id permitted to call the session-management API; repeat per caller. Without it, `/api` is off (404) |
| `--api` | gen-key, print-id | mint/print in the API salt domain (for `--api-allow`) instead of the session domain |
| `--tls-cert <path>` / `--tls-key <path>` | hub | serve HTTPS with your own PEM cert chain + key |
| `--acme-domain <d>` | hub | auto-obtain a cert via ACME/Let's Encrypt (repeat per domain) |
| `--acme-email <e>` | hub | contact email for the ACME account |
| `--acme-cache <dir>` | hub | persist ACME account + certs across restarts (recommended) |
| `--acme-production` | hub | use Let's Encrypt production (default: staging) |

The session id is `hex(argon2id(secret))` with a fixed application salt — a
memory-hard derivation, so a weak secret can't be cheaply brute-forced from the
public id. It's computed once per client connection, not per frame. Use
`print-id` to obtain the id for a secret (there's no one-line shell equivalent).

## Managing hub sessions over HTTP

An external tool can add and remove sessions at runtime instead of restarting
the hub with new `--allow` flags. The API is **off by default**: it only exists
when the hub is started with at least one `--api-allow <api-id>`.

API callers authenticate like sessions do — a secret key, screened by its
argon2id hash — but in a **separate salt domain**: mint a key with
`gen-key --api` (or derive with `print-id --key K --api`) and put the printed
API id on `--api-allow`. A session key is never an API credential and vice
versa, even if the same secret were reused.

```sh
# operator: mint an API credential and start the hub with it
shellglass gen-key --api          # key: <API_KEY>   api-id: <API_ID>
shellglass hub --bind 0.0.0.0:8080 --api-allow <API_ID>

# the built-in client (key via --key or SHELLGLASS_API_KEY):
export SHELLGLASS_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
shellglass sessions https://hub add <session-id> --slug demo
shellglass sessions https://hub list
shellglass sessions https://hub remove --slug demo   # or: remove --id <session-id>

# or any HTTP client (Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>):
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHELLGLASS_API_KEY" \
     -d '{"id":"<session-id>","slug":"demo"}' https://hub/api/sessions
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHELLGLASS_API_KEY" https://hub/api/sessions
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $SHELLGLASS_API_KEY" https://hub/api/sessions/by-slug/demo
```

| Route | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `POST /api/sessions` | register `{"id": <session-id>, "slug"?: <slug>}` — the public id from `print-id`, never a key. `201`; `409` when the id or slug is taken; `400` when malformed |
| `DELETE /api/sessions/by-id/<id>` | remove by **session id**. `204`; `404` unknown |
| `DELETE /api/sessions/by-slug/<slug>` | remove by **view slug**. `204`; `404` unknown |
| `GET /api/sessions` | list `[{id, slug, live}]` — `live` means an operator is currently pushing |

Removal by id and by slug are separate routes on purpose: an un-aliased
session's slug **is** its id, so a single guessing route could delete the wrong
thing. Deleting a session kicks its live pusher (whose next reconnect gets
`403`) and drops everything the hub stored for it.

A session added over the API is viewable immediately: until its pusher
connects, `/s/<slug>` serves the built-in page in the operator-offline state
(the same look as a live session whose operator dropped) and switches to the
real session automatically when the first push arrives. Runtime-added sessions
are **ephemeral** — a hub restart forgets them; the managing tool is the source
of truth and re-adds them.

## How it works

```
command in a PTY  ── output bytes ─►  long-lived vt100 parser
  → parser-agnostic StyledCell grid   → rectangle diffs (changed cells only)
  → SSE deltas, encoded once per frame for all viewers
  → viewer.js renders cells → HTML in the browser
```

The command runs in a pseudo-terminal you drive from your own terminal (the `script(1)`
model): its output is teed to your screen immediately and, in parallel, fed to a
long-lived vt100 parser snapshotted at up to 30fps. Each viewer gets a full frame on
connect, then only the **changed rectangles** — a keystroke costs bytes, not a full
screen — and a small baked-in renderer (`/viewer.js`) turns cells into HTML
client-side. Terminal resizes (`SIGWINCH`) reflow both the PTY and the browser. In hub
mode the client pushes frames over a **single persistent streaming connection** (not a
request per frame), so throughput isn't gated by round-trip latency; the hub diffs them
per session and re-serves the client's CSS, fonts, and render config. If the connection
drops (hub restart, network blip) the client re-registers and reconnects automatically —
and the local session pauses cleanly, showing the outage in your terminal until it's
back.

## Inline images

Terminal graphics are mirrored to the browser. When the session shows an image via any
of the three inline-image protocols, viewers see it too — positioned at its terminal
cell, scrolling with the content:

| Protocol | Emitted by (e.g.) | Coverage |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **kitty graphics** (`ESC _G`) | `kitten icat`, `timg`, `chafa -f kitty` | PNG and raw RGB/RGBA (re-encoded to PNG), chunked transfers, zlib compression, and the direct / file / temp-file / shared-memory transmission mediums |
| **iTerm2** (`OSC 1337 File`) | `imgcat`, `wezterm imgcat`, `chafa -f iterm` | single-shot and multipart transfers; browser-native image formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP) |
| **sixel** (`ESC P … q`) | `img2sixel`, `chafa -f sixel` | decoded and re-encoded to PNG (browsers don't render sixel) |

**The mirror only shows what your terminal shows.** At startup shellglass asks the
terminal which protocols it actually renders — kitty graphics via its query escape,
sixel via the Primary DA feature list, iTerm2 (which has no query) by a small
`TERM_PROGRAM` allowlist — and intercepts only those. A protocol your terminal doesn't
render passes through untouched, so the browser stays faithful to the local screen in
both directions: no image appears on the web that didn't appear in the terminal, and
none is lost that did.

Images behave like they do in a cell-based terminal: they scroll with the text, clip
against the top edge on the way out, and disappear when the screen region they occupy is
cleared or fully overwritten. Everything works in hub mode too — images ride the same
frame stream, and late-joining viewers get any image currently on screen. The read-only
SSH view is cells-only and does not show images.

## Read-only SSH view

Add `--ssh-bind <addr>` to `serve` or `hub` to also expose the session as a **read-only
ANSI terminal view** over SSH — a live mirror in a plain terminal, no browser needed:

```sh
# standalone: any username connects
./target/release/shellglass serve --ssh-bind 127.0.0.1:2222 -- htop
ssh -p 2222 x@127.0.0.1

# hub: the view handle (session id, or the slug if aliased) is the SSH username
./target/release/shellglass hub --bind 127.0.0.1:8080 --ssh-bind 0.0.0.0:2222 --allow "$ID"
ssh -p 2222 "$ID"@hub.example.com
```

The **view handle is the SSH username** — the same one that goes in the `/s/<…>` URL (the
session id, or its slug if you aliased one with `--allow <id>:<slug>`), so there's nothing
to enter. The view is strictly
read-only: input is dropped except `q` / Ctrl-C / Ctrl-D, which disconnect. A viewer
terminal smaller than the session shows a top-left crop with a one-line status notice, and
reflows on resize.

The SSH server uses its **own** ed25519 host key, kept separate from the machine's
`/etc/ssh` identity on purpose — a shared key would extend the host's SSH trust to this
accept-any read-only endpoint. Point `--ssh-host-key <path>` at a key to reuse across
runs; without it a key is generated and persisted (0600) under
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/shellglass/` so its fingerprint stays stable. The SSH view is optional
and unsupervised: if it can't bind (e.g. a privileged port), the HTTP mirror still runs.

## Fonts

`default_font` can be a single family or a **fallback stack** — `["Text Font", "Nerd
Font"]`. The browser resolves each character against the stack in order, so a Nerd Font
listed after your text font covers every glyph the text font lacks. That reproduces
Kitty's fallback with no `symbol_map` ranges at all (see `config.kitty.toml`).

By default `default_font` is `["monospace", "Symbols Nerd Font Mono"]`, so Nerd-Font
symbol glyphs render out of the box with **no config** if `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` is
installed system-wide (it's part of the standard Nerd Fonts packages). Override
`default_font` to use a different text font or symbol font.

**Fonts are served, so viewers render them without a local install.** Every family
referenced by `default_font`/`symbol_map` is located on the host running shellglass —
via [`fontdb`] (a pure-Rust, cross-platform system font database; Linux, macOS and
Windows, no subprocess), or an explicit `[fonts."Name"].path` — its file read once at
startup, and served: standalone at `/fonts/<i>`, the hub **per
session** at `/s/<slug>/fonts/<i>` (so two clients' fonts can't clash). The page's
`@font-face` points at those URLs; responses are Brotli/gzip-compressed and sent with a
day-long `Cache-Control` so a browser fetches each font once. A single face is extracted
from a `.ttc` collection (e.g. macOS's `Menlo.ttc`) and served as a standalone web font.
A font that can't be located is a soft failure (warn + skip); the browser just falls
back. A `[fonts."Name"]` entry is optional — use `path` to serve a specific file
(`.ttf`/`.otf`/`.ttc`/`.woff`/`.woff2`), or `system = "Other Name"` when the installed
family name differs from the key.

[`fontdb`]: https://docs.rs/fontdb

**Lines, blocks and powerline arrows are drawn, not fonted.** Box-drawing and block
elements (`U+2500–259F`), the legacy-computing mosaics (sextants `U+1FB00–1FB3B` and
one-eighth bars `U+1FB70–1FB7B`) and the powerline arrow separators (`U+E0B0–E0B3`) are
synthesized as geometry on a `<canvas>` laid over the text — snapped to device pixels, so
lines stay crisp, tile without seams, and render mixed light/heavy junctions (`┿ ╂ ┝`)
faithfully at any zoom or display scale (including moving a window between a HiDPI and a
regular monitor). These need **no font at all**, and the real glyph is kept underneath as
transparent text so selection and copy/paste still work. Only the long tail — smooth-mosaic
wedges, seven-segment and the rounded/flame powerline separators (`U+E0B4–E0D4`), plus
anything you point `symbol_map` at — falls through to the SVG-scaled font path below.

`symbol_map` is still useful alongside the stack: its matched glyphs are SVG-scaled to
lock to exactly one cell (so they tile seamlessly), which plain fallback — rendering at
the font's own advance — doesn't do. The remaining separators (`U+E0B4–E0D4`) stretch to
fill; other icons fit proportionally. `config.kitty.toml` reproduces kitty's zero-config
powerline rendering by serving kitty's bundled `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` as a fallback.

## Templating

The built-in page is a dark chrome with two nav toggles, each off by default and
remembered per browser in localStorage:

- **canvas** — the renderer switch, **on by default** (`?render=dom` flips a fresh
  browser to DOM mode). On = every update paints on the canvas (footer tag
  `canvas`), rendered by the terminal's own rules — ink seated inside the cell
  box, decorations clamped into the cell — with the DOM underneath as transparent
  ghost text so select/copy/find keep working. Off = the classic CSS-native DOM
  renderer: real links, native selection and find.
- **storm** — only shown in DOM mode; off by default (`?storm=on` opts in). Gates
  DOM mode's automatic escalation to the canvas under full-screen animation load
  (footer tag `storm`). Leave it off to keep full DOM text semantics at whatever
  frame rate the DOM manages.
- **CRT** — a CRT tube effect (scanlines, phosphor bloom, flicker, vignette; also
  `?crt`). Works in both renderer modes.

`?cursor=smooth` (opt-in, canvas rendering only) makes the cursor glide between
cells over ~80ms instead of teleporting.

For a fully custom page, point `template` at a full HTML document with three tokens
the renderer fills at serve time:

| Token | Filled with |
|-------|-------------|
| `{{style}}` | the generated `<style>` — terminal cell CSS + served-font `@font-face` |
| `{{screen}}` | the live `<div id="screen">…</div>` the SSE updater swaps (keep the id) |
| `{{script}}` | the `<script>` blocks that boot the live renderer (config + `/viewer.js` loader) |

```toml
# config.toml
template = "my-viewer.html"
```

Everything around those tokens is yours — nav, wrapper, footer, extra `<style>`. Only
`{{screen}}`'s `#screen` id is load-bearing (the updater targets it); the others can be
placed anywhere in the document. Terminal content that happens to contain a literal
token string is left intact. In hub mode the client pushes its template to the hub, so
custom pages work off-box too.

## Security notes

- The **secret** is a bearer capability. Anyone who has it can push to that session;
  anyone with the **view URL** can watch. Use a long random secret and share the URL
  only with people who should see the session.
- The secret travels in a header on the `/push` WebSocket upgrade. Terminate TLS so it
  isn't sent in the clear. The hub can do this itself:

  ```sh
  # your own certificate
  shellglass hub --bind 0.0.0.0:443 --allow "$ID" \
    --tls-cert /etc/ssl/hub.crt --tls-key /etc/ssl/hub.key

  # or automatic Let's Encrypt (needs a public DNS name resolving to this host,
  # and port 443 reachable — the TLS-ALPN-01 challenge is served on the same socket)
  shellglass hub --bind 0.0.0.0:443 --allow "$ID" \
    --acme-domain hub.example.com --acme-email you@example.com \
    --acme-cache /var/lib/shellglass/acme --acme-production
  ```

  ACME defaults to Let's Encrypt **staging** (untrusted certs, generous rate limits)
  so you can test the plumbing; add `--acme-production` for real certs. Always set
  `--acme-cache` or the account + certificate are re-issued on every restart.
  Otherwise, run behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (Traefik, nginx, …). The
  client's `push` URL just needs to be `https://…`, and the hub honors
  `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-Host` so the view URL it prints on connect
  matches the proxy's public address, not the hub's internal bind. The push is a
  WebSocket (`/push`), so forward the `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers — nginx then
  tunnels it without buffering (its default `proxy_request_buffering on` would
  otherwise stall the stream). Viewer streams (`/s/<id>/events`, SSE) send
  `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, so nginx won't buffer those either.
- The hub trusts allowed clients: it caps a single pushed WebSocket message at 16 MB
  (a full frame with fonts is smaller) but does not otherwise rate-limit the content.
  A bad-key flood is bounded (concurrent auth hashes are capped and each rejection is
  logged for fail2ban), but don't expose an open hub to the internet.
- The read-only SSH view (`--ssh-bind`) authorizes by the **session id in the username** —
  the same read capability as the view URL. It accepts any connection and shows the session
  read-only, so treat exposing it like sharing the view URL. It uses a dedicated ed25519
  host key, never the machine's `/etc/ssh` key.

## Status

Mirror an interactive command in a PTY (the `script(1)` model, one screen) with live
rendering, inline images (kitty graphics / iTerm2 / sixel, gated on what the terminal
renders), standalone + client/hub push, an optional read-only SSH view (`--ssh-bind`),
viewer templating (built-in page with a CRT toggle, or a custom template), and optional
hub TLS (own cert or ACME/Let's Encrypt). Modes are cargo features: the default build
is the full multi-call `shellglass`, and `cargo build --no-default-features --features
hub` (or `serve`, `push`) yields a slim build; per-mode binaries (`shellglass-hub`,
`shellglass-serve`, `shellglass-push`, `shellglass-gen-key`, `shellglass-print-id`)
wrap the same CLI code. Not yet: multiple sessions/panes in one view.
Not planned: scrollback — the mirror shows the live screen, like a glance over the
operator's shoulder; your own terminal already has history.
